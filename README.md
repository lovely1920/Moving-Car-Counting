# Moving-Car-Counting
#Developed a Python script using OpenCV for car counting utilizing computer vision techniques.
#Implemented background subtraction to detect moving objects in a video stream.
#Utilized Gaussian blurring and morphological operations for noise reduction and object identification.
#Defined conditions for identifying vehicles based on minimum width and height of bounding rectangles.
#Integrated a count line and centroid tracking to accurately count vehicles crossing a specified line in the video.
#Displayed real-time vehicle count on the video feed.
#Created a customizable and adaptable system for various video sources and scenarios.
